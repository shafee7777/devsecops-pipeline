# 🔐 DevSecOps Pipeline

A secure CI/CD pipeline showcasing automated SAST, DAST, container scanning, IaC scanning, dependency auditing, and secrets detection.  
This project demonstrates how to integrate security into every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

---

## 🚀 Features

- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**  
  Automated code scanning using tools like Semgrep or CodeQL.

- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**  
  Application scanning during runtime using tools like OWASP ZAP.

- **Container Image Scanning**  
  Vulnerability scanning for Docker images.

- **IaC Scanning (Infrastructure-as-Code)**  
  Terraform / Kubernetes configuration scanning.

- **Secrets Detection**  
  Automatic blocking of API keys, credentials, and secrets.

- **Dependency Auditing**  
  Alerts for vulnerable libraries and packages.

- **Security Gates in CI/CD**  
  Pipelines that fail when critical vulnerabilities are detected.
